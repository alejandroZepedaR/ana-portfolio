            Welcome to my professional portfolio. This collection represents the growth, dedication, and passion I’ve cultivated throughout my academic and professional journey, particularly during my time in the International Security Studies (ISS) program. This portfolio aims to demonstrate my abilities, principles, and experiences in a way that reflects my academic foundation and my dedication to making a significant impact on the world, particularly in the fields of international relations, security, and equity.

            The portfolio begins with my professional biography, which provides an overview of my credentials, experience, and achievements. Following it is my most recent resume, which highlights key roles and duties that have influenced my professional interests and skill set. My professional reflection essay offers insight into how my work and studies have prepared me for the next steps in my professional development.

            I've added a personal background section that outlines the values and life experiences that drive my passion for supporting marginalized groups and fighting for justice to provide context about who I am beyond my resume. My academic synthesis essay connects the themes and knowledge I’ve developed in the ISS program, reflecting the analytical and interdisciplinary thinking I bring to global issues.

            Lastly, I've chosen three writing samples that hold special significance for me. Each essay demonstrates the depth of my research, policy analysis, and strategic thinking while examining important subjects such as the consequences of gang violence in El Salvador, Poland's changing defense role in Europe, and maritime security in the South China Sea.
